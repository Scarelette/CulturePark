## Introduction

Cultural bias pervades many large language models (LLMs), largely due to data deficiency. Traditionally, cultural benchmarks are constructed by aggregating existing datasets, often sourced from platforms such as Wikipedia or social media. However, these approaches are heavily dependent on real-world data and human annotation, making them costly and difficult to scale. In response, this paper introduces \method, an LLM-powered multi-agent collaboration framework following cognitive theories. \method simulates cross-cultural human communication, serving as a robust method for data augmentation. It generates high-quality cross-cultural dialogues encapsulating human beliefs, norms, and customs. Utilizing \method, we generated 41,000 cultural samples and subsequently fine-tuned eight culture-specific LLMs. We evaluated these models across three downstream tasks: content moderation, cultural alignment, and cultural education. Our results show that for content moderation, our GPT-3.5-based models either matched or outperformed GPT-4 in eight cultural contexts. In cultural alignment, our models surpassed GPT-4 using Hofstedeâ€™s VSM 13~\citep{vsm13} framework. Furthermore, for cultural education, our approach demonstrated superior outcomes in both learning efficacy and user experience compared to GPT-4. \method proves essential for addressing cultural bias and advancing the democratization of AI, highlighting the critical role of culturally inclusive data in model training.

## Usage

### 1. Data Augmentation

- Download WVS file from https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSContents.jsp
- Download PEW file from https://huggingface.co/datasets/Anthropic/llm_global_opinions

#### 1.1. In-cultural Communication

```bash
python main.py --culture Arabic --v v1 --data_type wvq --cur_model gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 --g_num 500
```

Parameter: 
- culture: target culture. Now can select from Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, Germany, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Turkish. 
- v: communication style. v1 means self-guidance prompting. v2 means free chat.
- data_type: source of seed data.
- cur_model: model to power cross-cultural communication.
- g_num: generated data number


#### 1.2. Cross-cultural Communication

```bash
python main_cross.py --culture Arabic --v v1 --data_type wvq --cur_model gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 --g_num 500
```

Parameter: 
- culture: target culture. Now can select from Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, Germany, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Turkish. 
- v: communication style. v1 means self-guidance prompting. v2 means free chat.
- data_type: source of seed data.
- cur_model: model to power cross-cultural communication.
- g_num: generated data number

### 2. Fine-tune your own CulturePark

data_process.py is to process data for fine-tuning. 

- Step 1: Post process data. Run postProces() function.
- Step 2: Augment the answer. Run answerAug() function.
- Step 3: Finetune. Run finetune() function.
- (Optional) Step 4: format the data to finetune on Llama. Run generateData4Llama() function.

### 3. Fine-tune CulturePark-Llama-70b-chat

```bash
python llama_finetune.py --base_model "path_of_llama_70b" --new_model "path_of_new_model" --data_files "fine-tuning data path"
```
